\section{What We Need}\label{what-we-need}}

\hypertarget{financial-contributions}{%
\subsection{Financial Contributions}\label{financial-contributions}}

CyberDragons pride in its history of outstanding achievements in
cybersecurity competitions. However, many of our dedicated competitors
come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, with many relying on
Free and Reduced meal plans. The financial constraints associated with
travel costs and entry fees limit our ability to send more than one team
for many competitions. This limitation puts us at a significant
disadvantage compared to schools with larger budgets.

\hypertarget{professional-coaching-and-mentorship}{%
\subsection{Professional Coaching and
Mentorship}\label{professional-coaching-and-mentorship}}

While our school lacks a dedicated cybersecurity program or courses, our
team continues to excel and distinguish itself even against schools with
such programs. However, we recognize that to reach our full potential,
our students need guidance from experts in the field. Although our
seminars and competitions provide valuable experience, having tutors and
mentors would give us a competitive edge over other teams.

\hypertarget{field-and-work-experience}{%
\subsection{Field and Work Experience}\label{field-and-work-experience}}

GSMST offers two experiential learning courses crucial for student
graduation: the \emph{Junior Fellowship Experience} and the \emph{Senior
Capstone Experience}. The Junior Fellowship Experience serves as an
introduction to workforce and professional development and spans one
semester. The Senior Capstone Experience represents the culmination of
our students' high school journey, involving year-long collaboration
with a partnering company.

We believe our members would be outstanding interns in your company,
especially in the realm of cybersecurity. Their passion and natural
aptitude for the field, combined with real-world experience gained in
your organization, would not only benefit them but also enrich your
company with fresh perspectives and innovative ideas.

\hypertarget{how-you-can-contribute}{%
\section{How You Can Contribute}\label{how-you-can-contribute}}

\hypertarget{donations}{%
\subsection{Donations}\label{donations}}

By donating to CyberDragons, you would enable us to attend these
competitions in person, which provides invaluable networking
opportunities and enhanced learning experiences. Additionally, your
contributions would allow us to send multiple teams to a variety of
competitions, giving our talented students more opportunities to
showcase their skills and compete at the highest level. If you wish to
make a contribution, please make checks payable to \emph{GSMST Computer
Science Club} and send them to the following address:

GSMST Computer Science Club 970 McElvaney Ln NW, Lawrenceville, GA
30044.

For any further inquiries regarding payment, please contact our adult
sponsor \href{mailto:Julia.Rachkovskiy@gcpsk12.org}{Julia Rachkovskiy}.

\hypertarget{mentors}{%
\subsection{Mentors}\label{mentors}}

We are also seeking mentors who can provide training in various aspects
of cybersecurity, including ethical hacking, penetration testing, and
offensive security techniques. Your employees' expertise and guidance
could significantly enhance our team's skills and performance, ensuring
our continued success in competitions.

\hypertarget{internship-opportunities}{%
\subsection{Internship Opportunities}\label{internship-opportunities}}

Finally, we kindly request your company to consider providing internship
opportunities for our students. By taking them under your wing and
teaching them cybersecurity and networking skills, you would be
empowering the next generation of cybersecurity professionals while
gaining dedicated and talented individuals to contribute to your
organization's success.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Your support, whether financial, mentorship, or internship
opportunities, would greatly contribute to our mission of nurturing
ethical hacking professionals and ensuring their success in competitions
and beyond. Thank you for considering our partnership request in this
educational endeavor.
