# What We Need
## Financial Contributions
CyberDragons pride in its history of outstanding achievements in cybersecurity competitions. However, many of our dedicated competitors come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, with many relying on Free and Reduced meal plans. The financial constraints associated with travel costs and entry fees limit our ability to send more than one team for many competitions. This limitation puts us at a significant disadvantage compared to schools with larger budgets.

## Professional Coaching and Mentorship
While our school lacks a dedicated cybersecurity program or courses, our team continues to excel and distinguish itself even against schools with such programs. However, we recognize that to reach our full potential, our students need guidance from experts in the field. Although our seminars and competitions provide valuable experience, having tutors and mentors would give us a competitive edge over other teams.

## Field and Work Experience
GSMST offers two experiential learning courses crucial for student graduation: the *Junior Fellowship Experience* and the *Senior Capstone Experience*. The Junior Fellowship Experience serves as an introduction to workforce and professional development and spans one semester. The Senior Capstone Experience represents the culmination of our students' high school journey, involving year-long collaboration with a partnering company.

We believe our members would be outstanding interns in your company, especially in the realm of cybersecurity. Their passion and natural aptitude for the field, combined with real-world experience gained in your organization, would not only benefit them but also enrich your company with fresh perspectives and innovative ideas.
